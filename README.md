# PNP Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this Application

This Application is a research project for my internship as a Project Intern in Laguna State Polytechnic University. It is a platform for the Philippine National Police(PNP). It is currently still in development but is deployed in this [link](https://lspucrimereport.netlify.app/)

## Frameworks and Libraries Used

I used the following:

- React(JavaScript Library)
- React Bootstrap 
- Firebase (Database, Storage and Authentication)
- React-Leaflet
- Netlify Functions 
- Netlify (CI/CD)

## Run Locally

### Please make sure you have node installed!
### You will need to provide your own Firebase credentials! Go to Firebase using this [link](https://firebase.google.com/){:target="_blank"}.

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/m1ggy/pnp-app.git` or download the ZIP file with this [link](https://github.com/m1ggy/pnp-app/archive/refs/heads/pnp-app.zip){:target="_blank"}
2. Unzip the project(if downloaded using the link) and go to the project directory.
3. Now locate the folder `firebase` in the `src` directory.
4. Open `firebase.js` file and replace the config with YOUR OWN config. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP or the web application will not work locally.
5. Once replaced, change the directory to the parent directory and run `npm start`
6. If done correctly, the project will run on `localhost:3000`
7. Congrats! the application is now running.
